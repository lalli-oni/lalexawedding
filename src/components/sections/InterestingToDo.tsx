      <h2>Things to do in Iceland</h2>
      <p>
        Iceland is a beautiful country, with unique landscapes and very interesting history. We highly recommend natural hot pools and the municipal swimming pool (practically every town has at least one!).
      </p>
      <h3>Close to the wedding venue</h3>
      <p>
        The wedding will take place in Akranes, a small town, but here are a few things you can do in the area: 
        <a href="https://www.skagalif.is/is/visit-akranes">Visit Akranes</a> (translation available upper right corner).<br />
        We highly recommend the hot pools and the municipal swimming pools! Hot pools are mini paradises in Iceland.

      <h3>"The city" - Reykjavík</h3>
      <p>
        Downtown is Reykjavík is relatively small but vibrant and full of surprises. Notable list of places to check out:

      <h3>Other places in Iceland</h3>
      <p>
        You can take the <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-golden-circle">The Golden Circle</a> which is a half-day trip just outside of the city in the direction of the wedding venue.
        There you'll find Alþingi, UNESCO world heritage site, world first parliament, where Europe and North America continental shelves meet, a place of execution and Game of Thrones shooting location.
        Gullfoss, Europes largest waterfall. And Geysir (where the english word for geyser comes from!).
      </p>
      <p>
        The south coast also has a lot of great attractions, great waterfalls, epic black sandy beaches and other epic shit!
      </p>
      <p>
        On Reykjanes peninsula (where Keflavik airport is located) there are some interesting things happening, like a series of eruptions over the last few years. I'll try to ask my nationfolk to turn it on.
        There is also the <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/service-provider/5ec7d096a90548233654dd62">Blue Lagoon</a>, quite touristic but an amazing spectacle (the colors are really as strong as those internet images show!).
