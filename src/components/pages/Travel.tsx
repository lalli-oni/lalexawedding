      <h1>Travelling to Iceland</h1>
      <h3>Flights</h3>
      <p>
        NB: The main international airport is in Keflav√≠k, a town circa 40 min. drive from "the city" (Reykjav√≠k).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of airlines to choose from but Iceland has 2 airlines that operate a lot of routes.
        Play is a quirky budget airline, to be honest I have no issues with them.
        Icelandair is the older airline, a bit higher standards but honestly not a huge difference.
        Personally I'd say this is a luxury problem, you can choose to dish out a few more bucks for Icelandair but Play is a perfectly reasonable choice.
      </p>
      <h3>Getting around</h3>
      <p>
        Unless you are spending more than a couple of days in the country or don't intend to stay somewhere with good public transport connections (no trains in Iceland!) then we recommend renting a car.
        We have a discount code from Blue Car rental: <a href="https://www.bluecarrental.is/book/cars/?affiliate=Lalexa2025">Lalexa2025</a>. Make sure the discount is shown when selecting a car!
      </p>
      <p>
        There are buses operating to/from the airport. But if you could use a ride you can tell us when you are arriving/departing and we can see if we can arrange a ride.
        We will be busy but excited to hang out with you as much as possible üíñ!
      </p>
      <h3>Close to the wedding venue</h3>
      <p>
        The wedding will take place in Akranes, a small town, but here are a few things you can do in the area: 
        <a href="https://www.skagalif.is/is/visit-akranes">Visit Akranes</a> (translation available upper right corner).<br />
        We highly recommend the hot pools and the municipal swimming pools! Hot pools are mini paradises in Iceland.

      <h3>"The city" - Reykjav√≠k</h3>
      <p>
        Downtown is Reykjav√≠k is relatively small but vibrant and full of surprises. Notable list of places to check out:

      <h3>Other places in Iceland</h3>
      <p>
        You can take the <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-golden-circle">The Golden Circle</a> which is a half-day trip just outside of the city in the direction of the wedding venue.
        There you'll find Al√æingi, UNESCO world heritage site, world first parliament, where Europe and North America continental shelves meet, a place of execution and Game of Thrones shooting location.
        Gullfoss, Europes largest waterfall. And Geysir (where the english word for geyser comes from!).
      </p>
      <p>
        The south coast also has a lot of great attractions, great waterfalls, epic black sandy beaches and other epic shit!
      </p>
      <p>
        On Reykjanes peninsula (where Keflavik airport is located) there are some interesting things happening, like a series of eruptions over the last few years. I'll try to ask my nationfolk to turn it on.
        There is also the <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/service-provider/5ec7d096a90548233654dd62">Blue Lagoon</a>, quite touristic but an amazing spectacle (the colors are really as strong as those internet images show!).
